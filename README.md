# Information about this version
I am currently working on it, so theres nothing to run right now. If there is something added, use the help from the information below.

## Installing
Git clone this repository, then run the ``setup.py`` file.

Afterwards, in any Linux/MacOS command terminal do:

``python3 setup.py`` or windows cmd ``python setup.py``

On windows, there can be much problems, such as these.

Its fine, doesnt cause any problems, just ignore it.

And also, if you dont have python installed, after running python in cmd it will open up microsoft store with the python package.

But if it doesnt, install it through microsoft store manually. Its called ``Python 3.10``

## Running
After complete setup, you are able to run the main script.

Its the same as installing, but instead of ``setup.py`` run ``pyhelpy-gui.py``
