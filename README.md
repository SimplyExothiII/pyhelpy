# Information about this version
I am currently working on it, so theres nothing to run right now. If there is something added, use the help from the information below.

## Installing
Git clone this repository, then run the ``setup.py`` file.

Afterwards, in any Linux/MacOS command terminal do:

``python3 setup.py`` or windows cmd ``python setup.py``

On windows, if you dont have python installed, after running python with the batch script, it will open up microsoft store with the python package.

But if it doesnt, install it through microsoft store manually, its called ``Python 3.10``, or do the recommended way which is installing latest stable python from the [original python website.](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)

## Running
After complete setup, you are able to run the main script.

Its the same as installing, but instead of ``setup.py`` run ``pyhelpy-gui.py``
