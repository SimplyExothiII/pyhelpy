## Text signs
[Hi] stands for Help information, usually needed in issues. If you have an issue, add the info. If you need to you can censor things you want.

[i] stands for information, basically text.

[+] stands for user input.

[?] stands for questions.

## Text
Answers are case sensitive, so if you want to use functions like the file creating function just type out the function like this:

``File``

(the answers are always listed in questions like so)

What function do you wish to use?

(File, Folder etc.)

or

Functions: File, Folder, etc.

If for example you want the File function, just input File

## Installing
Git clone this repository, then run the ``setup.py`` file.

Afterwards, in any command terminal do:

``python3 setup.py`` or windows cmd ``python setup.py``

On windows, there can be much problems, such as these.

Its fine, doesnt cause any problems, just ignore it.

And also, if you dont have python installed, after running python in cmd it will open up microsoft store with the python package.

But if it doesnt, install it through microsoft store manually. Its called ``Python 3.10``

## Running
After complete setup, you are able to run the main script.

Its the same as installing, but instead of ``setup.py`` run ``pyhelpy.py``
