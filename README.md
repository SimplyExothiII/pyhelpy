(the answers are always listed in questions like so)

(File, Folder etc.)

or

Functions: File, Folder, etc.

If for example you want the File function, just input File

## Installing
Git clone this repository, then run the ``setup.py`` file.

On mac/linux:

``python3 setup.py``

On windows, check the [document](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows)

After complete setup, you are able to run the main script.

Its the same as installing, but instead of ``setup.py`` run ``pyhelpy.py``
