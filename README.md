# v.2.0.0
Pyhelpy wont receive any more updates. This is the final version, unless there are some bugs that need to be fixed.

## Installing
First of all, you need to install appJar:

``pip3 install appjar``

Tkinter is installed on windows in default libraries, but if you dont have tk on Linux:

run this with your favorite AUR helper if you are on an arch distribution ``AUR tk``

Then simply clone the project to where you want it in.

## Running
``python3 pyhelpy-gui``

On windows, if you dont have python installed, after running python through cmd, it will open up microsoft store with the python package.

But if it doesnt, install it through microsoft store manually, its called ``Python 3.10``, or do the recommended way which is installing latest stable python from the [original python website.](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
