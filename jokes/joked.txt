A guy is sitting at home when he hears a knock at the door. 
He opens the door and sees a snail on the porch. 
He picks up the snail and throws it as far as he can. 
Three years later there’s a knock on the door. 
He opens it and sees the same snail. 
The snail says: ‘What the hell was that all about?’
